# MissingBothXY
Simulation code for Tan, R. (2023). Nonparametric regression with nonignorable missing covariates and outcomes using bounded inverse weighting. Journal of Nonparametric Statistics, 35, 927-946.

To reproduce the simulation, run Simulation.m and Simulation_M.m files. Un/comment the corresponding lines to select a particular simulation setting.

Simulation.m is for all estimators and models (i) to (iv) using the linear g_{r^x,r^y}'s.

Simulation_M.m is for m_{MLE}, m_{CMLE} and m_{EE} and models (i) to (iii) using the quadratic g_{r^x,r^y}'s.
